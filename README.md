# Hangman in BASH
A basic UNIX terminal based hangman game written in Bash.

This is a hangman game that I wrote in the Bourne again shell (Bash UNIX shell) while trying to learn some of the syntax. The main game is started by executing the hangman script using:

> ./hangman

in a bash terminal. This game looks for a dict.dat file full of words that are randomly selected from.

Enjoy!
